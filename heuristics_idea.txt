Possible heuristics

0. Is the answer correct?
1. Checking whether step structures can be parsed?
2. Check whether arithmetic expressions evaluate correctly between brackets.
3. Do quantities show up previously e.g. if you see an expression [15 + 2 = 17], do 15 or 2 show up in previous steps or the problem?

Note - Rules like #3 could result in reward hacking.
