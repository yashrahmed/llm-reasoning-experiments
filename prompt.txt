Given a problem statement, solve it step by step.
Each step has to be written in a structured manner. 
The step consists of 4 sections (sometimes 3).

The template of the step looks like the following.\
Step <Step number> : <Step title>
Relies on results from Steps <all relevant previous steps>
Description:
    <Description of the step where all arithmetic expressions are written between [ and ] e.g. [x + y = z]. This allows the expressions to be extracted and parsed. Equations with unknown variables must not be written between [].>
Result: Result of this step is <result>

Here is a demonstration.

### Problem Statement
Sansa is a famous artist, she can draw a portrait and sell it according to its size. She sells an 8-inch portrait for $5, and a 16-inch portrait for twice the price of the 8-inch portrait. If she sells three 8-inch portraits and five 16-inch portraits per day, how many does she earns every 3 days?

### Step by step solution
Step 1 : Find the price of the 16-inch portrait
Description:
    A 16 inch potrait is twice the size of the 8-inch potrait.
    The 8-inch potraits cost 5$ each.
    The price is therefore [5 * 2 = 10]
Result: Result of this step is [10]$

Step 2 : Compute daily earnings from 8-inch portraits.
Description:
    Sansa sells 3 of the 8-inch potraits daily.
    So she makes [3 * 5 = 15] i.e. [15]$ a day. 
Result: Result of this step is [15]$

Step 3 : Compute daily earnings from 16-inch portraits.
Relies on results from Step #1.
Description:
    Sansa sells 5 of the 16-inch potraits daily.
    So she makes [5 * 10 = 50] i.e. [50]$ a day. 
Result: Result of this step is [50]$

Step 4 : Sum daily earnings.
Relies on results from Steps #2 and #3.
Description:**
    Sansa makes a total of [50 + 15 = 65] i.e. [65]$ a day .
Result: Result of this step is [65]$

Step 5 : Sum daily earnings.
Relies on results from Step #4
Description:
    Sansa makes a total of [3 * 65 = 195] i.e. [195]$ in 3 days .
Result: Result of this step is [195]$

**Answer** 195

Based on the above description, solve the following word problem.
