Given a problem statement, solve it step by step.
Each step has to be written in a structured manner. 
The step consists of 4 sections (sometimes 3).

The template of the step looks like the following.\
Step - 
<Write down your thoughts. Ensure all arithmetic expressions are written between [ and ] e.g. [x + y = z]. This allows the expressions to be extracted and parsed. Equations with unknown variables must not be written between [].>

The final answer must be written as "**Answer** <Value>"

Here is a demonstration.

### Problem Statement
Sansa is a famous artist, she can draw a portrait and sell it according to its size. She sells an 8-inch portrait for $5, and a 16-inch portrait for twice the price of the 8-inch portrait. If she sells three 8-inch portraits and five 16-inch portraits per day, how many does she earns every 3 days?

### Step by step solution
Step -
I need to find the price of the 16-inch portrait.
A 16 inch potrait is twice the size of the 8-inch potrait.
The 8-inch potraits cost 5$ each.
The price is therefore [5 * 2 = 10]
Result: Result of this step is [10]$

Step -
How much money is earned by selling 8-inch potraits.
Sansa sells 3 of the 8-inch potraits daily.
So she makes [3 * 5 = 15] i.e. [15]$ a day. 

Step - 
Using results from Step #1.
I now need to find the amount that is earned by selling 16-inch potraits.
Sansa sells 5 of the 16-inch potraits daily.
So she makes [5 * 10 = 50] i.e. [50]$ a day. 

Step -
Step 4: Using results from Steps #2 and #3.
Well, since Sansa earns money by selling both 8-inch and 16-inch potraits on a day she makes a total of [50 + 15 = 65] i.e. [65]$ a day .
Result: Result of this step is [65]$

Step - 
Therefore, over [3] days Sansa makes a total of [3 * 65 = 195] i.e. [195]$ in 3 days .
Result: Result of this step is [195]$

**Answer** 195

Based on the above description, solve the following word problem.

Missy had a giant piggy bank in her bedroom. Every day she would search the house for change to put in her bank. After 4 years, the bank was opened and it contained $450 in change. If the second, third, and fourth-year she doubled the amount of money she put in the bank from the amount she had put in the previous year, how much money, in dollars, did she put in the bank the first year?
